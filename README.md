# duplicate-photos

Automatic processing and organization of photos and videos to identify duplicates. Primary method is via comparing hashes, but other methods may be added in the future. pHash could be useful for detecting similar photos. Technically could be easily modified to work on any type of file, but this was specifically created to organize the multiple backups of family photos I had.
